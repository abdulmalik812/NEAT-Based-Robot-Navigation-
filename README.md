# 🧠 NEAT-Based Obstacle-Avoiding Robot Simulation

This project implements a top-down simulation of a differential-drive robot that learns to navigate and avoid obstacles using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. Developed as part of the **Undergraduate Summer Research Fellowship (USRF)** at **Amity University, Noida**, this work explores the integration of evolutionary computation and real-time robotics-inspired simulations.

## 📈 Fitness Function

The robot's fitness is determined by:
- Distance covered (exploration)
- Speed of motion
- Avoidance of collisions

A robot is rewarded for covering new ground without hitting obstacles, making the evolution goal-safe and efficient navigation.
